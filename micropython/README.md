# MicroPython port for Phoenix-RTOS 

## Overview 

This is a Micropython port for Phoenix-RTOS operating system. Currently it is working on following targets:

 * `ia32-generic`
 * `armv7m7-imxrt106x`

Currently we are working to bring this port onto other targets so this list is going to be expanded.

For building micropython we are using `unix` port provided by Micropython that is patched to suite Phoenix-RTOS system. All configuration and patches are stored inside `micropython-1.15-config/` directory and are implemented by `build.sh` script

## File structure

 * `build.sh` - building script that prepares environment and executes `make` related commands
 * `micropython-1.15.tar.xz` - (may be missing before first build) archieve with MicroPython codebase 
 * `micropython-1.15-config/`
   * `files/`
     * `001_mpconfigport.mk` - file containing Micropython port configuration of used third party libraries. As selection of those libraries can heavily impact the size of MicroPython binary size this configuration is stored as a whole file for easy management. During build it is copied into MicroPython codebase.
   * `patches/`
     * `01_libm_absent_libm.patch` - arithmetic functions missing in `libphoenix` substitution
     * `02_libm_ifdefs.patch` - math related functions missing in `libphoenix` substitution in MicroPython libraries
     * `03_mpy-cross_configs.patch` - minor cross compilator patch
     * `04_mpy-cross_Makefile.patch` - minor patches for cross compilator Makefile 
     * `05_os_configs.patch` - patches for internal port configurations
     * `06_os_main.patch` - incorporating stack and heap size of MicroPython
     * `07_os_Makefile.patch`- disabling `Werror` compilation flag and addition of arithmetic functions absent in `libphoenix`
     * `08_os_varia.patch` - missing defines corrections 
     * `09_py_ifdefs.patch` - math related functions missing in `libphoenix` substitution in MicroPython code
  * `exp_prefabs` - prefabricated files with expected output to some MicroPython tests. For most tests such files are generated using Python 3.10 or are provided by authors of MicroPython. Unfortunately there are some cases in which MicroPython 1.15 is incompatible with newer versions of CPython. For these tests expected outputs were generated manually using MicroPython 1.15 installed on standard Unix system
